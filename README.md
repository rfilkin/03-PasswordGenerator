# 03-PasswordGenerator

# purpose
The purpose of this project is to allow the user to generate secure passwords on demand.

# functionality
- The user can select parameters such as length and character type to customize what kind of password they want.
- Input validation will alert the user if there is an issue with their inputs
- Generated password will be displayed in a read-only block for added security (this cannot be highlighted). Instead, users can use the "copy to clipboard" button.

# notes
- There is a currently-unused file in the repository called "script_alert_based.js". This was made for scaffolding purposes and is not longer in use. However, it is kept in for archival purposes.
